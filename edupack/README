To compile the whole BSPedupack package on a UNIX system:
    $ make
(where the $ stands for the prompt).

This produces five executables:
    ip     for inner product computation (Chapter 1)
    bench  for BSP benchmarking (Chapter 1)
    lu     for LU decomposition (Chapter 2)
    fft    for fast Fourier transforms (Chapter 3)
    matvec for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (Chapter 4)

To produce only the ip program:
    $ make ip

To clean up, deleting object files and executables:
    $ make clean

---------------------------------------------------------------
To run the ip program on at most three processors:
    $ bsprun -npes 3 ip
    How many processors do you want to use?
    2
    Please enter n:
    10
    Processor 0: sum of squares up to 10*10 is 385
    This took only 0.001064 seconds.
    Processor 1: sum of squares up to 10*10 is 385
The program or the user can decide to use less than three
processors; here two processors are actually used.
Note that the output of the different processors is multiplexed
and hence can be garbled.

To run the bench program on four processors:
    $ bsprun -npes 4 bench

    Range h=0 to p   : g= 633.9, l= 290.9
    Range h=p to HMAX: g= 35.8, l= 2157.2
    The bottom line for this BSP computer is:
    p= 4, r= 9.047 Mflop/s, g= 35.8, l= 2157.2
Note that you may have to change the parameters to perform sensible
benchmarks. Decrease NITERS if timing takes too long; increase it if 
the resolution of the clock is low. Increase MAXH if you are interested
in larger h-relations.

It is always useful to plot the time of an h-relation
as a function of h, e.g. by using gnuplot.
To do this, delete all lines from the output except those starting with
"Time of", name the resulting file bench_out, and use the gnuplot command
    plot [0:256] 'bench_out' using 3:6
Plotting is mandatory if you get negative values for g or l.

To run the lu program on four processors
using a square cyclic distribution:
    $ bsprun -npes 4 lu
    Please enter number of processor rows M:
    2
    Please enter number of processor columns N:
    2
    Please enter matrix size n:

    LU decomposition of 3 by 3 matrix
    using the 2 by 2 cyclic distribution
    Start of LU decomposition
    End of LU decomposition
    This took only 0.004386 seconds.
    
    The output permutation is:
    i=0, pi=1, proc=(0,0)
    i=2, pi=0, proc=(0,0)
    i=1, pi=2, proc=(1,0)
    
    The output matrix is:
    i=0, j=0, a=1.000000, proc=(0,0)
    i=0, j=2, a=1.000000, proc=(0,0)
    i=2, j=0, a=0.500000, proc=(0,0)
    i=0, j=1, a=1.000000, proc=(0,1)
    i=1, j=0, a=0.500000, proc=(1,0)
    i=1, j=2, a=1.000000, proc=(1,0)
    i=1, j=1, a=1.000000, proc=(1,1)
    i=2, j=1, a=0.500000, proc=(0,1)
    i=2, j=2, a=1.000000, proc=(0,0)
Note that on output pi(i)= i+1 mod n,
and a[i,j]= 1 for i<=j and a[i,j]= 0.5 for i>j.
To prevent huge amounts of output for large n,
remove some print statements.

---------------------------------------------------------------
To run the fft program on four processors,

    $ bsprun -npes 4 fft
    How many processors do you want to use?

    Please enter length n: 
    8
    FFT of vector of length 8 using 4 processors
    performing 5 forward and 5 backward transforms
    proc=0 j=0 Re= 0.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=0 j=4 Re= 4.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=1 j=1 Re= 1.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=2 j=2 Re= 2.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=1 j=5 Re= 5.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=2 j=6 Re= 6.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=3 j=3 Re= 3.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    proc=3 j=7 Re= 7.000000 Im= 1.000000 
    Time per initialization = 0.000445 sec 
    Time per FFT = 0.000508 sec 
    Computing rate in FFT = 0.267717 Mflop/s 
    Absolute error= 3.140185e-16 
    Relative error= 3.925231e-17 

The problem size n must satisfy n >= 2p,
and n,p must be powers of two.
Note that on output Re=j and Im=1. The error 
and flop rate are computed automatically.
To prevent huge amounts of output for large p,
change NPRINT (the number of values per processor printed).
Decrease NITERS if timing takes too long; increase it if
the resolution of the clock is low.

---------------------------------------------------------------
To run the matvec program on two processors,
 
    $ bsprun -npes 2 matvec
    How many processors do you want to use?
    2
    Sparse matrix-vector multiplication using 2 processors
    Please enter the filename of the matrix distribution
    test.mtx-P2
    Please enter the filename of the v-vector distribution
    test.mtx-v2
    Please enter the filename of the u-vector distribution
    test.mtx-u2
    Initialization for matrix-vector multiplications
    Start of 10 matrix-vector multiplications.
    End of matrix-vector multiplications.
    Initialization took only 0.002390 seconds.
    Each matvec took only 0.000398 seconds.
    The computed solution is:
    proc=0 i=0, u=11.000000 
    proc=0 i=1, u=6.000000 
    proc=0 i=3, u=41.000000 
    proc=1 i=2, u=45.000000 
    proc=1 i=4, u=92.000000 
The three input files have been provided. They are in the output format
of the sparse-matrix partitioner Mondriaan. The matrix is taken from 
Example 4.2 in the accompanying book, and the data distribution
is as given in Figure 4.3. Note that the vector distributions
are read from file, but that the numerical values of the input vector are
set to (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..., n) by the driver program bspmv_test.
As a result, v differs from the vector v displayed in Figure 4.3,
and u from the displayed u.
The number of processors in this small test is fixed at p=2.
